Every product has a write and a compare.

By historical accident, there is also a hitcoll_read.cc; it has not
been updated recently. The compare code does reading, of course. The
hitcoll_read code also shows use of H5Literate.

Top-level container exists because you can't set properties on the
root group. We want to be able to set properties at the top-level.
